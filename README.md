=============

Raise awareness of mobile capabilities while further learning android programming. 

Purpose of Design:
- Raise awareness of how powerful the web has become and give understanding on how feasible cyber attacks have become in 
the recent years.
- Raise the concern on how new terrorist attacks can remotely be done and yet still harm just as much as physical attacks

Inspiration:
- Hasan Elahi : The Art of Self-Surveillance 
- SKYFALL (The Movie)
- CyberWarfare in UK article (April 3, 2012)
- US Network attack by Beijin article (June 15, 2011)
- Chinese hackers have attacked the computer networks of the United States Governmental and American corporation stealing
  research, source code, and development.

Thesis:
As our nation continues to emerge into a more cyberspace environment, the idea of terrorism is now gearing towards a less
physical attack but rather a remote controlled attack through cyberwarfare as information is more feasible. 
 
First Application:(cyber_Redirect)
Make user believe they are entering the page of choice but redirect them to different webpages of bomb and gun making 
with ordinary house hold items. 
 
Second Application:(cyber_Toast)
User expects to log into Facebook and believe they have entered some security page. Begin entering information while the
userâ€™s inputs are being shown as pop up messages.
 
Exhibition:
Some of the common responses I received from users was a feeling of fear and shock. Many of them could not believe that 
bomb and gun making details are easily available with step by step instructions to videos demonstrating it all. Once that
shock was out of mind, the Boston Marathon tragedy was tied to how feasible information is. Another point that came 
across was the idea of how one puts complete trust upon applications and websites not really knowing if that information
is truly secure or not.

What's Ahead:
As my senior year is coming to an end and having accomplished what I wanted for my final design product, I can 
confidently say that this finished product has become a prototype for what is to come. As my interest in this idea of 
cyberwarfare grows, so do my ideas to push this project even further. I really want to create a piece that can serve as a
perfect example of a horrible scenario where the unexpected can happen, keeping the common theme of cyber attacks and how
feasible information has become.
